# Agent entry point

Read [README.md](README.md) first. It is the canonical maintenance policy for
this AMD repository; this file is the discovery entry point, not a duplicate
runtime or benchmark registry.

Before work, read the [current benchmark report](linux/hardware/CURRENT-AMD-BENCHMARKS.md)
and [canonical runtime handoff](linux/network/LINUX-LLM-RUNTIME-HANDOFF.md), then check
current Git status and relevant live ownership/locks. Dated results are evidence;
selected settings and candidates must remain distinguishable.

Standing user requirement, October 27: keep both maintained AMD repositories,
README, this AGENTS entry point, benchmark Markdown/results and runtime handoff
current after relevant changes so another agent can take over anytime. Preserve
history and private evidence. Before yielding, record completed verification,
actual blockers, active work/locks, unfinished steps and a concrete next action.
Review public sanitization, commit/push intended changes to both AMD repositories,
and verify synchronization; report any exact outstanding publication step.
Do not rerun completed GPU tests just to refresh documentation.

Keep private paths, credentials, logs and client state out of public exports.
Preserve unrelated user changes and existing hardware/memory/ownership guards.
The [cross-repository audit](linux/hardware/AMD-NVIDIA-GAP-AUDIT-2026-10-27.md) is read-only:
ask which proposed gaps to fill before implementing them. Do not copy AMD runtime
settings or schedules onto NVIDIA without separate authorization and qualification.
